# Pyspark_version_Predicting_Customer_Churn_in_Telecommunication_Operators

Customer turnover refers to a decision made by the customer on the term of business relationship. Customer loyalty and customer turnover always add up to 100%. If a company has a 60% loyalty rate, then customer loss taxes are 40%. According to the 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. Therefore, it is very important to predict the users who are likely to abandon the business relationship and the factors that affect how the customer's decisions.<br>
In this project, I predicted Customer Churn at a Telecommunications Operator. <br> <br>

The scripts were made in pyspark, using Pandas, Numpy, scipy and Scikit-Learn frameworks. The project is documented and presented in the jupyter notebook (Predicting_Customer_Churn_in_Telecom_Operators.ipynb) and in a pdf file (Predicting_Customer_Churn_in_Telecom_Operators.pdf).<br> <br>
